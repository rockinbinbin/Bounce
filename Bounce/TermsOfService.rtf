\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b \cf0 Accepting these Terms\
BY DOWNLOADING THE APP OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS BELOW.
\b0  Please read all of the terms before you use the Service. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don\'92t agree to all of the terms below, you may not use the Service. \

\b Modifications\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b0 \cf0 We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. For example, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed about our practices. \
Whenever we make changes to these Terms, they are effective when the revised Terms are posted unless we notify you otherwise. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms have been posted, then you will be deemed to have accepted the changes to these Terms.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b \cf0 Privacy Policy\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b0 \cf0 For information about how we collect, use and share information about users of the Service, please see our Privacy Policy. [

\i0 ]\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b \cf0 Description of the Service\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b0 \cf0 Through the Service, you can contact other users of the Service, designated by you, to respond to your request for someone to walk home with you (each, a \'93
\b Request
\b0 \'94). You can establish a list of the users who you would like to receive a Request from you (each, a \'93
\b Leaving Point
\b0 \'94) based on a location (such as your neighborhood, home or dorm) (each, a \'93
\b Homepoint
\b0 \'94). A user must request to be a part of a Leaving Group and be approved to join that Leaving Group by a current member of the group before the user can interact with that Leaving Group. Any current member of a Leaving Group can add or remove any user at any time. You can also accept or deny an invitation to join another Leaving Group in your sole discretion.\
If you are out late at night, or otherwise would feel safer if someone would walk home with you, you may send a Request to your Leaving Group. Those in your Leaving Group who are nearby can accept or deny the Request. The Service provides different filters that you may use, if you so choose, to narrow down the list of those who accept the Request. Of those who accept your Request, it is solely up to you with whom you choose to walk home. Once you have selected that person(s), you and that person(s) will be able to chat with each other through the App to discuss the logistics of how to get home. \
You are responsible for your use of the Service, including any content you provide in a Request or a response to a Request. Bounce does not represent or warrant that any user\'92s Request or response is accurate or complete, or that a user in your Leaving Group will be able to walk home with you at a particular time.\
PLEASE USE COMMON SENSE. THE SERVICE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR 9-1-1 EMERGENCY SERVICES. IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE IN DANGER OR IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SERVICES, PLEASE DIAL 9-1-1 FROM YOUR DEVICE.\
For more information about the Service, please see our FAQs. [

\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b \cf0 Governing Law; Arbitration\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b0 \cf0 PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH BOUNCE AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM BOUNCE.\
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.\
In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and Bounce agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Detroit, Michigan. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Bounce are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Bounce will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\
If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Detroit, Michigan. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.
\i  \

\i0 For any disputes that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Detroit, Michigan and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms or the use or the Service.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b \cf0 General\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\pardirnatural\qj

\b0 \cf0 Enforcement of these Terms is solely at Bounce\'92s discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\
These Terms (and the other policies and terms referred to above) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and they supersede any prior agreements that may have been made.\
